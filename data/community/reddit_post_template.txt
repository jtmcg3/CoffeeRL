# ðŸ”¬ Help Build a Better Coffee Brewing Assistant! [Research Project]

Hi r/coffee! I'm working on an AI-powered V60 brewing assistant and need your expertise to make it better.

## What I'm Building
A system that can recommend grind adjustments based on your brewing parameters and taste results. Think of it as having an experienced barista help you dial in your V60.

## How You Can Help
I'm collecting real brewing experiences from the community. If you've brewed a V60 recently and can remember the details, I'd love to hear about it!

**What I need:**
- Coffee amount (g)
- Water amount (g) 
- Grind size
- Total brew time
- How it tasted
- What you'd adjust next time

## Why This Matters
Most brewing guides are generic. This project aims to create personalized recommendations based on real experiences from coffee lovers like you.
