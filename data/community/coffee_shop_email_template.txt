Subject: Research Collaboration - V60 Brewing Data Collection

Dear [Coffee Shop Name] Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding a research project on V60 brewing optimization that I believe would interest your team.

## Project Overview
I'm developing an AI-powered brewing assistant that provides personalized grind adjustment recommendations based on brewing parameters and taste outcomes. The goal is to help coffee enthusiasts achieve better extractions more consistently.

## How You Can Help
I'm seeking experienced baristas and coffee professionals to contribute brewing data. This involves sharing details from V60 brews including:
- Brewing parameters (coffee/water ratio, grind size, time)
- Taste assessment
- Recommended adjustments

## What's In It For You
- Early access to the brewing assistant tool
- Recognition as a contributing partner
- Insights from the aggregated brewing data
- Potential collaboration opportunities

The data collection process is simple and takes just a few minutes per contribution. All data is anonymized and used solely for improving brewing recommendations.

Would you be interested in participating? I'd be happy to discuss this further and answer any questions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
