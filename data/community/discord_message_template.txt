Hey coffee friends! ðŸ‘‹

I'm building an AI brewing assistant and could use your V60 experiences to train it.

Quick ask: If you've made a V60 recently, could you share:
â€¢ Coffee/water amounts
â€¢ Grind size & brew time
â€¢ How it tasted
â€¢ What you'd change

Takes 2 mins: [Form Link]

Goal is to create better, personalized brewing advice based on real experiences rather than generic guides.

Thanks! â˜•ðŸ¤–
